# PiSync Optimization Strategy for 100k Devices

This document outlines the strategy for optimizing the PiSync system to handle 100,000+ devices efficiently.

## Current Challenges

With 100k devices syncing regularly, we face several challenges:

1. High write volume (100k+ sync events per hour during peak times)
2. High read volume for analytics and monitoring
3. Need for real-time failure detection
4. Data storage growth management
5. System resilience under load

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Database Optimization

#### Sharding Strategy

MongoDB sharding will be implemented to distribute data across multiple servers:

- Shard by `device_id` to ensure even distribution
- Use compound shard key (`device_id`, `timestamp`) for time-range queries efficiency

#### Indexing Strategy

Critical indexes for performance:
- `{ device_id: 1, timestamp: -1 }` - For device history queries
- `{ timestamp: -1 }` - For recent events across all devices
- `{ total_errors: 1, timestamp: -1 }` - For failure monitoring

#### Data Lifecycle Management

- Implement time-based collections (e.g., monthly partitions)
- Archive older sync data to cold storage after 90 days
- Maintain summarized historical data for long-term analytics

### 2. Application Architecture

#### API Layer Scaling

- Deploy as containerized microservices with auto-scaling
- Implement API gateway with rate limiting and caching
- Use separate service instances for read vs. write operations

#### Asynchronous Processing

- Implement message queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for sync event processing
- Use worker processes to handle event processing, analytics, and notifications
- Batch process non-critical operations

#### Caching Strategy

- Redis cache for frequently accessed device data
- Cache device failure status to reduce database load
- Implement TTL-based cache invalidation

### 3. Performance Optimizations

#### Payload Optimization

- Minimize payload size by using efficient data formats
- Implement compression for network transfers
- Batch sync events when appropriate

#### Connection Pooling

- Optimize MongoDB connection pools
- Implement connection persistence where appropriate
- Use keepalive connections for devices with frequent syncs

#### Query Optimization

- Use projection to limit returned fields
- Implement pagination for all list endpoints
- Use aggregation pipeline optimization techniques

### 4. Monitoring and Reliability

#### Health Monitoring

- Implement comprehensive health checks
- Use distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger)
- Monitor database query performance

#### Circuit Breakers

- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Graceful degradation under excessive load
- Fallback mechanisms for critical operations

#### Proactive Alerting

- Set thresholds for system metrics
- Alert on abnormal patterns (e.g., sudden increase in sync failures)
- Monitor database performance metrics

### 5. Cost Optimization

- Implement tiered storage based on access patterns
- Optimize instance sizes based on load patterns
- Use read replicas for reporting and analytics queries

## Expected Results

With these optimizations implemented, the system should:

- Handle 100k+ devices syncing hourly with <100ms p95 response time
- Support 1000+ concurrent API requests
- Maintain data durability with zero data loss
- Scale linearly with device count increases
- Operate efficiently with optimized infrastructure costs
